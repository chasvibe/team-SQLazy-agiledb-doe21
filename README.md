# u04a-sql-scrum  

This repo is for documentation of assignment u04a-sql-scrum.  
  
The goal of this assignment is to design and implement a SQL database in Postgres.  
In the design phase we've created a logical model and a physical model to visualise entities, attributes, relationships and constraints.  
To implement the SQL schema we've used psql (CLI) and pgadmin (GUI).  
A big part of this assignment was to learn, understand and use Scrum to manage workflows.

## SQL modelling  

This is the logical and physical model we created during the first three sprints of this assignment. Models are created in Lucidchart.
